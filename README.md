Intelligence

Intelligence can be defined as the ability to learn, understand, reason, and adapt to new situations and solve problems. In other words, Intelligence is a complex and multifaceted concept that refers to a person's ability to learn, reason, understand, perceive, and solve problems. It can be described as the capacity to think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, adapt to new situations, and learn from experience.



About Artificial Intelligence


Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, decision-making, and language understanding.
AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. These technologies are used to create intelligent systems that can analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns, and make decisions based on that data.

What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of Science which deals with helping machines finding solutions to complex problems in a more human-like fashion. This generally involves borrowing characteristics from human intelligence, and applying them as algorithms in a computer friendly way.

AI is achieved through the development and use of algorithms and mathematical models that enable machines to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions based on that data. These algorithms are typically trained on large datasets using machine learning techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Applications of AI

AI technologies include natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, expert systems, and neural networks, among others. 
These technologies can be used in a variety of applications, such as :
speech recognition, image and video analysis, autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants, and predictive analytics.

There are two types of AI:

Narrow or weak AI refers to systems that are designed to perform specific tasks, such as playing chess, recognizing faces, or translating languages. 

General or strong AI, on the other hand, refers to systems that are capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do.

 AI perspective:

From an AI perspective, researchers have pursued several different versions of AI, each with a different focus and approach. One approach to defining intelligence is in terms of fidelity to human performance. This approach seeks to create AI systems that can perform tasks as well as, or better than, humans.
Another approach is to use an abstract, formal definition of intelligence called rationality, which loosely speaking means doing the "right thing." This approach seeks to create AI systems that can make decisions that are rational, based on logical reasoning and the available information.
The subject matter of AI also varies. Some researchers consider intelligence to be a property of internal thought processes and reasoning. They focus on developing AI systems that can reason, learn, and think like humans. 
Other researchers focus on intelligent behavior, an external characterization. They seek to develop AI systems that can perform tasks that require intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, making decisions, and solving problems.
Overall, the different versions of AI reflect the diverse approaches and goals of researchers in the field. By exploring these different approaches, AI researchers can gain a deeper understanding of intelligence and how it can be replicated in machines. This understanding can ultimately lead to the development of more advanced and capable AI systems.

From these two dimensions—human vs. rational and thought vs. behavior, there are four possible combinations

Acting humanly: The Turing test approach
Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach
Acting rationally: The rational agent approach
Thinking rationally: The “laws of thought” approach
(Acting,Thinking)(rationally,humanly)

"AI acting humanly" refers to the goal of creating artificial intelligence systems that can perform tasks in the same way as a human being would.
The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question “Can a machine think?” A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.

For Machines to think, we would need:
natural language processing to communicate successfully in a human language;
knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears;
automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.
To pass the total Turing test, a robot will need
computer vision and speech recognition to perceive the world;
robotics to manipulate objects and move about.

AI thinking humanly: 
The concept of "AI thinking humanly" involves developing artificial intelligence systems that can think, reason, and make decisions in the same way as human beings. This is one of the most challenging goals of AI, as it requires creating systems that can not only perform specific tasks, but also understand and reason about the world in a way that is similar to human cognition.

To achieve this goal, researchers have developed various approaches, such as cognitive architectures, symbolic reasoning systems, and neural networks, that attempt to model the structure and function of the human brain. These approaches aim to capture the complexity of human thought and reasoning by integrating knowledge representation, perception, and decision making.


AI acting rationally:

The concept of "AI acting rationally" refers to the goal of creating artificial intelligence systems that can make decisions and take actions that are optimal or rational given a particular objective or goal. This is one of the main goals of AI, as defined by computer scientist Stuart Russell and AI researcher Peter Norvig.
One approach to achieving rational AI is by designing systems that can reason based on formal logic and mathematical principles. Another approach is by developing systems that can learn from data and experience, and that can use machine learning algorithms to make predictions and decisions.

AI thinking rationally: 


Rational thinking is the process of making logical, objective, and well-informed decisions based on available evidence and reasoning. In AI, rational thinking is often implemented through various forms of logical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and decision-making algorithms.

Logical reasoning involves using deductive or inductive reasoning to draw conclusions from given premises. Deductive reasoning involves starting with a general rule and using it to make specific predictions. Inductive reasoning involves starting with specific observations and using them to make generalizations or hypotheses. Both forms of reasoning are used in AI systems to infer new knowledge from existing data.
Probabilistic reasoning involves reasoning under uncertainty. In probabilistic reasoning, the AI system assigns probabilities to different outcomes based on available evidence and uses these probabilities to make decisions. For example, in a medical diagnosis system, the AI system may assign probabilities to different diseases based on the patient's symptoms and medical history.
Decision-making algorithms involve selecting the best course of action from a set of possible choices. These algorithms are often based on a set of criteria or objectives that are used to evaluate each choice. For example, in a chess-playing AI system, the decision-making algorithm may evaluate different moves based on their potential to win the game.
 
History of AI:

Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)
      Year 1943: The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of artificial neurons.
           Year 1949: Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the connection          strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.
      Year 1950: The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered Machine learning in 1950. Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a Turing test.
      Year 1955: An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial intelligence program"Which was named as "Logic Theorist". This program had proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.
